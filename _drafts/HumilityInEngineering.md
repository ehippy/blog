In writing code, software engineers live in a world of strictures. Uncompromising compilers simply must be appeased. Hundreds of times a day engineers will be told once more, `SyntaxError: Unexpected token` and will have to dutifully redress their latest failures. Software never works the first time, and it's rarely anywhere close by attempt 100.

This becomes the rhythm of the work, sometimes for hours at a stretch, days at a time. One's forced to recognize their position in this relationship, and only through careful practice and dedication do they start to develop a smooth relationship with the machine.

What the engineer wants to accomplish with the computer has to be reached in compromise. Humility in this machine-man relationship is forced if it is undertaken.

### Repetition

We improve what we practice.
