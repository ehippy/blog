I’ve spent the better part of two decades leading engineering work that scales. I’ve played key roles in guiding products from early-stage scrappiness to long-term viability — including one that became [a killer, high-growth product](https://bombbomb.com). My work tends to sit at the intersection of systems, people, and thoughtful progress.

I've built across the stack, [led teams through high-growth phases](/twosliceteams/), and recently focused on using large language models to improve developer experience and product impact. These days, I think a lot about how the tools we make ripple out into the world—not just in terms of performance and reliability, but [sustainability](/accidentally-carbon-neutral/), clarity, and human impact.

I live in Colorado Springs with my two kids, where we spend a lot of time outdoors. You'll find us getting dirty camping, hiking, or swimming. My nine-year-old is getting into cooking, which means our kitchen experiments are getting more interesting (and messier).

This site is where I write about technology, [philosophy](/my-thesis/), [parenting](/childs-choices/), and whatever else catches my attention. It's also [open source](https://github.com/ehippy/blog) and [accidentally carbon-neutral](/accidentally-carbon-neutral/).
