I'm a software engineer who's spent my career building systems that connect people and solve real problems. I work primarily in C#, Python, and web APIs, with a lot of AWS thrown in for good measure. These days I'm thinking more about how the code we write affects the worldâ€”not just in terms of revenue, features and performance, but in terms of sustainability and human impact.

I live in Colorado Springs with my two kids, where we spend a lot of time outdoors. You'll find us camping, hiking, or swimming. My nine-year-old is getting into cooking, which means our kitchen experiments are getting more interesting (and messier).

This site is where I write about technology, philosophy, parenting, and whatever else catches my attention. It's also [open source](https://github.com/ehippy/blog) and accidentally carbon-neutral.
