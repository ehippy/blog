One of my favorite technology events, [DVLP Denver](https://developdenver.org/) was kind enough to allow me present a talk I'm pretty fond of, [Serverless Hotdog Detection](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dD4L0T2ms08jJcvriuyi0J6vaKQjI-1E6JLXYoLvtgM/edit?usp=sharing) last fall. I was delighted to see that they posted the video of it yesterday!

Special thanks to the DVLP Denver video crew for the flattering aspect ratio! In the talk I reference [this great talk from the creator of the serverless framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mNhMuBkIK8) that I also recommend you check out! Happy geeking!
