I've been feeling a bit in-between lately. Maybe some goals would help?

<!--more-->

### Attitude
 - **Cultivate an adequate counterbalance of positivity** about the future. Sometimes I get fatalistic about the next 40 years will be like on the biosphere and in the global economy. Being down about it a lot sucks. Not head in the sand;  breathing now.
 - Get help. People keep praising therapy, and I harbor a defensive posture about it. Expensive? In moderation, maybe a good investment.
 - Play with programming again! I miss it a lot. 

### Physical
 - Two moments every day for health: yoga, hiking, strength. Keep that watch happy. Work on feeling good and not dying.

 - **Count calories every day.** I legitemetly lost 55lbs in 2018, then in 6 months put most of it back on. 
 - Hold my weight below 220lbs through 2020. For the kids, Patrick! 
 

### Career
 - Make every day at the office feel like the Summer of 2013.
 - Help BombBomb buy a sick company by 2025.
 - Build a modest little SaaS hobby product.

### Financial
 - Pay for my house & kids' education with a stellar BombBomb performance
 - Have a lifetime savings plan together in 2019, get help here. We really wing this far more than we should.

### Family
 - Get on a mountain with my dad twice a year
 - Catch a fish with Leo, Read GHoGK w/ him
 - Wren to 11
 - Be excllent to Bri

### Artistic
 - Paint with Grammy a lot.

### Pleasure

### Public Service
 - Strengthen Ronald McDonald House relationship

### Education

Non-exhaustive. Got kinda thin at the end there.
